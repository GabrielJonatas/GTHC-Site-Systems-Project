                    My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chose the soccer ball when I practice.
                    It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. 
                    It just won't fit!

                Once Sasha saved my life. 
                When I was only 4 years old. 
                I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the stret.
                Of course I did not think to look for cars!
                Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto  the sidewalk.
                I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been.
                Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was
